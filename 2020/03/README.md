# Through the snow and past the trees

[AOC 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3)

So, we get the tobagon and being the slide down. The first part has us checking
to see how many trees we would hit going down at one angle. 

The second one wants us to try various angles and provide a product of the different tallies.

Note, the angle/route will extend beyond the width of the provided data... but the question
notes that the forest repeats towards the right. nice.
